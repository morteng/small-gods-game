# Small Gods - Development Notes

## Game Concept

A god game inspired by Terry Pratchett's *Small Gods*. The player is a minor deity who must cultivate genuine belief among NPCs through indirect influence (whispers, omens, dreams, miracles). Rival spirits compete for the same followers. NPCs run on a programmatic simulation layer; an LLM "backfills" rich narrative whenever the player pays attention.

**Two-layer architecture:**
- **Sim layer** (always running) — NPC state: beliefs, needs, mood, relationships. Belief propagates along social graphs. Events (droughts, festivals, rival actions) shift NPC needs and create opportunities for divine intervention.
- **Narration layer** (on-demand) — LLM generates dialogue, scene descriptions, and dramatic moments from compact sim state when the player focuses on anything. Returns structured state deltas that feed back into the sim.

## Project Documentation

**Primary References:**
- **[VISION.md](docs/VISION.md)** — 🧭 **Canonical** cosmology, belief model, and start-to-end arc. Read first; all other design docs defer to it on cosmology / belief / Fate / progression.
- **[ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)** — 🛣️ The **single** forward plan (replaces the old IMPLEMENTATION.md/MVP_ROADMAP.md). Every not-yet-built track lives here; each gets its own brainstorm → spec → plan under `docs/superpowers/`.
- **[TECH_SPEC.md](docs/TECH_SPEC.md)** - Complete technical specification (gameplay systems, architecture, data models)

> Completed/superseded specs & plans are archived under `docs/archive/` (organized by epic). New design work goes in `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/`.

**Current Status:** The core arc is shipped to `main` — Spec A (spine), Time (Spec B/C), Phase 7 (NPC sim), Phase 8 (divine actions), the Dilemma MVP / Track 1 belief loops, D1 (mortality/birth/lineage), D2 (deterministic time-skip), and Phase 9 (LLM backfill: client/prompt/writeback + player provider config + live-apply). Built on top since: the parametric building pipeline (blueprint→manifold→img2img→SpritePack), metric scale standardization, settlement growth (S1–S6), a **WebGPU-only renderer** (the Canvas2D/PixiJS scene path was retired), GPU terrain + a world connectome, and a **WebGPU-native immediate-mode UI** (`src/render/ui/`, now the default chrome). `game.ts` is a coordinator (~1100 LOC) over 18 `src/game/` modules. **~3600 tests passing (~458 files).** The single forward plan is `docs/ROADMAP.md`; remaining LLM work = capable-tier invocation (Track 4 / Fate, `llmClientCapable` seam exists but uncalled) + a conversation UI. For live session state / active epics, see the session memory (`MEMORY.md`), not this file.

Sim is fully deterministic with seedable RNG; snapshot/replay layer supports scrub + commit + re-roll; summoned Time bar UI with past-veil scrubbed treatment, clickable history strip of past commits/whispers above the transport row, jump-forward presets (+10/+25/+50y), and keyboard shortcuts T/Space/1/2/4/8/Esc. `state.paused` retired in favor of `scheduler.getRate()`. The whole `src/sim/` is `Math.random`-free (guarded by `tests/unit/no-random-in-sim.test.ts`).

**Phase 7 Complete:** NPC simulation layer with tick system, belief propagation, activity state machine, settlement events (8 event types), and event ring buffer.

**Phase 8 Complete:** Divine action system with whisper, omen, dream, miracle, answer prayer. Power economy regenerates from belief × understanding × devotion.

**D1 Complete:** NPCs age, die (convert `npc`→`remains`, never deleted), and reproduce (diluted-faith children). Lineage queries span living + remains. `MortalitySystem` + `BirthSystem` (0.25 Hz, seeded). Closed-form `projectTurnover` bridge for D2.

**D2 Complete:** Deterministic time-skip — `applySkip` (closed-form "jump N years") + one-way commit boundary (`commitSkip`/`SnapshotStore.reset`). Survivors keep frozen belief, no power accrues; the LLM era-authoring half is deferred to Track 4 (Fate).

## Known gaps & gotchas (code reality)

- **`World` has TWO index layers.** `EntityRegistry` has its own spatial/kind/tile indexes AND `World` (`world.ts`) keeps separate `spatial`/`kindIdx`/`tagIdx`; `query()` uses World's. When mutating `x/y/kind/tags`, call **`World.updateEntity()`** (it syncs both) — never mutate entity position directly.
- **LLM backfill uses the configured provider** (`LlmBackfillService`, `src/game/llm-backfill.ts`); `game.ts` builds it via `createProvider(loadProviderConfig())` and passes the real client. The service only falls back to `MockLLMProvider` when constructed with no `client`. (The old "hardcodes MockLLMProvider at game.ts ~1270" gotcha is obsolete — that path is gone post-decomposition.) Saving in the LLM settings now **rebuilds the live client in place** via `Game.applyLlmConfig` → `LlmBackfillService.setClient` (no page reload). `Game.llmClientCapable` is built ready but **uncalled** — a Track-4 / Fate seam.
- **Time-Debug snapshot/inject are honest stubs** (disabled `makeStubButton()`s in `src/dev/TimeDebugPanel.ts`). Wiring Save/Load → `TimelineController`/`snapshot.ts` and Inject → settlement events (`world.activeEvents` + `settlement_begin` log) is a ROADMAP item.
- **All `src/sim/` randomness flows through `ctx.rng`/passed `rng` (seeded sfc32), never `Math.random`** — enforced by `tests/unit/no-random-in-sim.test.ts`. New sim code must follow this or the guard test fails.
- **Building sprites flow through ONE pipeline (runtime + author-time):** blueprint → manifold geometry → magenta-backed grey init (`compositeOverChroma`) → OpenRouter img2img (default model `black-forest-labs/flux.2-klein-4b`, `BUILDING_IMAGE_MODEL`; the vendored library was generated with the older gemini-2.5-flash-image and is orphaned until a funded reseed) → chroma-key (`src/render/chroma-key.ts`) → **quality gates** (border-keyed fraction ≥0.6 + silhouette IoU ≥0.7 vs the geometry mask) → **register onto the geometry grid with a negotiation band** (geometry alpha rules the eroded core, the LLM's alpha wins within ±~4% of the silhouette edge, beyond is clipped; missing core pixels flood-fill from neighbours, chroma residue scrubbed — `registerAlbedo` in `src/render/sprite-postprocess.ts`, pure buffers, Node+browser) → palette-quantize → persist. `GeneratedBuildingArtSource` (`src/render/generated-building-art-source.ts`) runs it at runtime (validate-BEFORE-persist; bad gens get one retry then a session-only null, never poisoning IndexedDB; ≤2 concurrent paid calls), checking IDB → vendored base library → paid generation. **Author-time seeding is the same pipeline:** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=… npx tsx scripts/seed-building-art.ts` (or `--plan` to dry-run) writes `public/asset-library/building-sprites/` so keyless players get art; keys match worldgen exactly (placer synthesizes presets unpatched with name-derived seeds). The old PixelLab pixflux building path (`gen-buildings.ts`) is **deleted** (its imports died with the Blueprint epic); `pixflux-compiler.ts` survives only for floor-tile scripts. `no-three-in-bundle.test.ts` still keeps three/gl out of the bundle. Geometry G-buffer hashes are pinned in `tests/unit/assetgen-golden.test.ts` — intentional geometry changes update the pins AND bump `ART_RECIPE_VERSION`. **Geometry/art recipe is at v13** (`ART_RECIPE_VERSION`; medieval detail + generative openings + procedural weathering + lit windows + real flora generators): material-driven eaves/verges, `half_hip` (gablet) roofs, gabled `dormer` features, ridge louvres + slimmed multi-chimneys (a blueprint with NO vent features gets NO seeded default chimney), `jetty` body param, generative per-type window programmes, round-wall openings, rectangular plans — design values in `docs/reference/medieval-building-reference.md`. **Note:** runtime paid generation defaults OFF and a reseed is currently frozen (user: "don't spend money yet"), so in-game buildings render as GREY massing until a funded reseed.
- **Every IndexedDB open/transaction must race `withIdbTimeout`** (`src/services/idb-guard.ts`). A wedged backing store (browser killed mid-write) leaves `indexedDB.open()` pending FOREVER — no success/error/blocked — which froze boot on the loading screen and starved building art (2026-06-12). The three stores (`save-store`, `generated-art-cache`, `pixellab`) are guarded and degrade (fresh world / vendored art / dropped autosave); new IDB code must follow the same pattern.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** ES modules, bundled by **Vite**
- **WebGPU** is the only scene renderer (terrain + entities + UI); Canvas2D 2D-ctx is kept for overlays/compositing. WebGPU-native immediate-mode UI lives in `src/render/ui/`.
- The live overworld is **noise-based** (`terrain/terrain-generator.ts`: fractal noise → biomes → tiles) + connectome/settlement-driven — this superseded WFC in the 2026-05 world-gen-overhaul. **WFC** (Wave Function Collapse) primitives are **retained but dormant**: `generateWithWFC` is bypassed (never called at runtime), `autotiler` still uses WFC `TILES` metadata, and the Cell/Grid/Solver primitives are reserved for a planned zone-WFC meta-layer / future dungeons.
- **Vitest** for testing (~3600 tests, ~458 files)
- Embeddable via `Game` class + postMessage API (iframe path being superseded by the WebGPU-UI / MCP epic)
- `@/` path alias → `src/`

## Rendering

**WebGPU-only iso renderer.** The Canvas2D/PixiJS scene backends and the `RenderMode`
abstraction were deleted in the WebGPU-only cleanup (`pixi.js` dropped, `iso-renderer`/
`renderer`/`pixi-entity-layer` removed); a device with no WebGPU gets an honest "WebGPU
required" overlay. Canvas2D 2D-ctx survives only for overlays/UI compositing.
- **Terrain** = buffer-driven GPU heightfield (`src/render/gpu/terrain-field.ts` packs the
  per-cell height/colour storage buffers; the shader generates + lifts the grid). Height =
  `baseSeedHeight ⊕ deformations` (road grade-cuts today; rivers/earthworks as producers land).
- **Entity pass** = y-sorted neutral draw list (`src/render/iso/entity-draw-list.ts`) executed
  by the WebGPU scene (`src/render/gpu/gpu-scene.ts`), instanced; `poly`/`circle` shape pass +
  foot-z terrain lift for placement parity.
- **Banded lighting**: building sprites are `SpritePack`s (albedo + co-registered normal/material,
  from the IDB cache / vendored library / `composeStructure`); lit by ambient + one directional
  sun (`src/render/lighting-state.ts`), diffuse quantized into crisp bands, AO from material.G.
  **Projected cast shadows** via a stencil-union pass. Dev toggle "☀️ Lighting".
- **UI**: WebGPU-native immediate-mode (`src/render/ui/`) is the default chrome (`Game.barebones`,
  `?legacyui` flips back to the legacy DOM/Canvas2D chrome that's still suppressed behind flags —
  see the legacy-chrome retirement epic). `pixi.js` must never be imported (guard tests enforce it).
- Camera: pan (drag) + zoom ladder (integer / 1-over-integer rungs, pixel-snapped origin).

## Iframe Embedding

The game is designed to be embeddable in a secure iframe (for MCP UI):

```ts
import { mount } from './embed/mount';
const game = mount('#container');
await game.generateWorld();
```

- `Game` class: `new Game(containerElement, options?)` — mounts into any DOM element
- No `document.body` assumptions — everything scoped to container
- No inline event handlers — all `addEventListener`
- CSP-compatible — no dynamic code execution, no inline scripts
- PostMessage API for host communication
- Responsive to container size changes via ResizeObserver

## Development

```bash
npm run dev        # Start Vite dev server
npm run build      # TypeScript check + Vite production build
npm test           # Run all tests (vitest)
npm run test:watch # Watch mode
npm run bus -- ping        # Drive a running game from the CLI (needs the tab on ?bridge)
npm run mcp                # Stdio MCP server over the running game (registered in .mcp.json as `small-gods`)
```

**Dev bus bridge (out-of-process control).** With the game opened on `?bridge`
(read-only) or `?bridge=rw` (writes), the in-browser `GameBus` seam is published
over a WebSocket broker (Vite dev plugin on `/__bus`) so a CLI (`tools/bus-cli.ts`)
or a stdio **MCP server** (`tools/mcp-server.ts`, 14 tools) can drive + inspect a
live game. The browser tab is the *game peer* and does all dispatch, so it inherits
the bus's gating/replay. **DEV ONLY — Fate and the WebGPU UI call `GameBus`
in-process and must never round-trip through the bridge.** Spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-21-bus-over-ws-bridge-mcp-spec.md`.

## Gameplay Architecture

Phases 7–8 shipped; Phase 9 (LLM backfill) is largely shipped; rivals (Track 3) and the DM agent (Track 4 / "Fate") are still ahead — see [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

- **NPC sim** (✅): personality traits, belief per spirit (faith/understanding/devotion), needs (safety/prosperity/community/meaning), social graph, event ring buffer, mortality + birth + lineage (D1)
- **Divine actions** (✅): whisper, omen, answer prayer, dream, miracle — each costs belief-power; understanding gates sign-perception & prayer efficacy (Track 1). Extended by **belief-granted powers + the divine inbox** (a god's vocabulary = what its believers think it can do).
- **LLM backfill** (🟢): ~500-token prompt → narrative + JSON state delta, target <200 ms; client/providers/writeback + player provider-config UI + live-apply all shipped. Runs the **fast/chat tier** (`DEFAULT_CHAT_MODEL`, currently `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`) of the two-tier OpenRouter catalog (`src/llm/openrouter-catalog.ts`). Remaining Track-2 work: conversation UI + interaction memory.
- **Rival spirits** (⬜ Track 3): personality-driven programmatic actions, LLM-narrated when intersecting with the player
- **Fate / DM agent** (⬜ Track 4): background LLM on the **capable tier** (`DEFAULT_CAPABLE_MODEL`, currently `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`) via the built-but-uncalled `Game.llmClientCapable` seam — managing pacing, plot threads, rival coaching, escalation; also the LLM era-authoring half of the D2 time-skip loop. The codebase calls this layer **"Fate."**
