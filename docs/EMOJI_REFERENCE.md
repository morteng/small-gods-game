# Emoji Reference

Visual representation system for the world.

---

## Design Principle

Emojis are the visual language of the game. They must be:
- **Readable by LLMs** (they can "see" and reason about them)
- **Intuitive for humans** (immediate recognition)
- **Extensible** (new entities get appropriate emojis)

The LLM can suggest emojis for new entities it creates.

## LLM Emoji Selection

When the LLM creates a new entity, it suggests an emoji:

```
NEW ENTITY: "The Crimson Stalker"
- Category: Creature
- Subcategory: Blood spirit, vampiric
- Suggested emoji: 🩸 (blood drop)
- Alternative: 🧛 (vampire)
- Reasoning: Unique blood-based entity, 🩸 distinguishes from standard vampire

RENDERING DECISION:
Use 🩸 as primary, with 🧛 as fallback for systems without blood emoji
```

## Composite Scenes

Multiple emojis combine to tell stories:

```
🌳🌳🐺🌳🌳   A wolf lurks in the forest
🌾🌾👤🏠🌾   A farmer at their home
🏛️🙏🙏🙏🏛️   Worshippers at the shrine
⛰️🐉⛰️⛰️⛰️   Dragon in the mountains
